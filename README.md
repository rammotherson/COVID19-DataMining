# COVID-19-Analysis
This is an analysis which I did on the COVID-19 situation in India. 

The analysis is based on three datasets. Two of these datasets are sourced from the Kaggle dataset 'COVID-19 in India' submitted by Sudalai Rajkumar and 3 other collaborators. Both these datasets contained data about the COVID-19 situation in India at a state-level and at an individual-level. The other dataset was created by yours truly based on the number of AADHAAR cards assigned in India as of 2019. It also contained data on the area covered by each Indian state.

Throughout the analysis, I tried putting up relevant figures to understand the current situation in India. The data is valid as of 25th April 2020.
